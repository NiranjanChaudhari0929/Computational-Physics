for L=1 
the true value of magnetic field (by solving the integral is = 8.994430382*10^-8
error from trapezoidal is around 3.56 * 10^-4 %
error from gaussian is around 3.72 * 10^-4 %

it is very close to the actual value because we have taken step size of trapezoidal to be very small and for gaussian the function can be 
approximated to polynomial of degree 10 (as z varies from -0.5 to 0.5) so it gives relatively accurate answer.




for L=100
the true value of magnetic field by solving the integral is 1.99960612*10^-9
error from trapezoidal is around 9.6 %
error for gaussian is around 266%

the reason for 9.6 % error for trapezoidal method is because step size is not small enough to get accurate answer.

the reason for very large error in gaussian is because we cannot approximate the integrand to a polynomial with reasonable degrees
for this case we have taken degree of polynomial to be 10 (for which z varies from -50 to 50) thus the reason for very large error.
