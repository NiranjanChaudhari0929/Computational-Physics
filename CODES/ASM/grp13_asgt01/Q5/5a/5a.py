#The Lorenz model is used to study the climate change and is given by dx/dt=a(y-x),dy/dt=-xz+bx-y,dz/dt=xy-cz
#where a = 10, c = 8/3 are some constants. b denotes the temperature difference between the top and bottom
#surfaces of the fluid. Solve the equations with RK-4 method with a = 10, c = 8/3 and b = 5, 10, 25. Plot the
#following:
#(a) z as a function of time for b = 5, 10, 25 for x = 1, y = z = 0. You can move from t = 0s to t = 50s. Is
#there any stricking difference at b = 25?
#(b) The trajectory of Lorenz model (for b = 25) in x âˆ’ z plane with initial condition as x = 1, y = z = 0
#(c) The trajectory in yz plane when x = 0 with b = 25.
#(d) The trajectory in xz plane when y = 0 with b = 25.
